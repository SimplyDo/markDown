#[Markdown → HTML](http://simplydo.com/markDown) in real time

*Note: This Read Me Text was actually written in Markdown using "Markdown → HTML"*

"Markdown → HTML" uses [showdown.js](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown) to convert [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to HTML. [Angular JS](http://angularjs.org/) provides the real time part and it is all glued together by little bit of CSS and JS so you can [use it all on the web](http://simplydo.com/markDown).
